One year, to the day
Since you put on the night
One year, to the day
That you shut out the light

I've made up my mind

Oh, I'll never say those words again
No, not to anyone that matters

Small change, in my hand
And the rain on the stair
Some train, over there
I could go anywhere

Stop wasting my time

Oh, I'll never say say those words again
No, not to anyone that matters
I'll never say the things I said
Now that you're gone
Oh, I'm shattered

I've made up my mind

Oh, I'll never say those words again
No, not to anyone that matters
I'll never say the things I said
Now that you're gone
Oh, I'm shattered

I know I've got to get away
Girl's got to move along
From this town
Now that you're not around
From this town
Oh, now you're not around.
