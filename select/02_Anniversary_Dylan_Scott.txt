I know you're getting ready
I know we're in a hurry
Got a dinner reservation
Around 8:30
So whatcha say, we go ahead and cancel it?
I can barely handle you in that dress

With skin that smooth
It's hard to keep my hands off you
Got a few things in mind I wanna do
Baby, why save it
When I can lay ya down now and later?

Put some rose petals out on the sheets
Make this bedroom feel like a suite
Girl, ya know we ain't even gotta leave
Tonight I'll love you like, love you like it's our anniversary
(Like it's our anniversary)

I can see it in your eyes
Girl, ya think I'm playing
But we ain't going nowhere
This room is where we're staying
We can make it like a second honeymoon (honeymoon)
Gonna love like the night that I said I do

With skin that smooth
It's hard to keep my hands off you
Got a few things in mind I wanna do
Baby, why save it
When I can lay ya down now and later?

Put some rose petals out on the sheets (on that sheet)
Make this bedroom feel like a suite (like a suite)
Girl, ya know we ain't even gotta leave (gotta leave)
Tonight I'll love you like, love you like it's our anniversary
(Like it's our anniversary)
