[01:04.13] A year ago, today we stood
[01:07.94] Above this same awakening world
[01:11.51] I held you
[01:13.98] You never wanted me to know
[01:27.48] 
[01:19.91] Another year ago, today
[01:24.19] Before this same awakening world
[01:27.49] I held you
[01:29.91] I never meant to let you go
[01:43.41] 
[01:37.42] There was a moment
[01:39.93] There always is
[01:47.43] 
[01:44.90] When time stood still
[01:47.45] And always was this
[01:56.95] 
[01:52.60] One endless moment
[01:55.66] You turn in pain
[01:59.41] And I always let you go
[02:10.91] 
[02:04.19] Over and over again
[02:13.69] 
[02:39.94] A year ago, tonight we lay
[02:43.89] Below this same remembering sky
[02:47.44] I kissed you
[02:50.17] You never wanted me to know
[02:55.92] Another year ago, tonight
[02:59.93] Behind the same remembering sky
[03:03.43] I kissed you
[03:05.89] I never meant to let you go
[03:19.39] 
[03:13.45] Another moment
[03:15.72] There always is
[03:23.22] 
[03:20.94] As time stands still
[03:23.42] And always is this
[03:32.42] 
[03:28.54] One endless moment
[03:31.92] You tell me all
[03:35.42] And I hold you and I kiss you
[03:39.46] And I never let you go
[03:43.93] I never let you go
[03:47.94] I never let you go
[03:51.92] Never let you go
[03:56.21] Never let you go
[04:01.58] Never let you go
